# Description

This application was created for HR or Managers to build team rosters that include employee name, position, email address, phone number, GitHub account and/or School. The information required varies depending on the employee you are adding. Once the roster is generated, a nice looking interface displays your team with clickable links for email addresses and GitHub accounts.
